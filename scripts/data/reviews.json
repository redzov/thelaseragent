They did all the calibration, preventative maintenance, and even updated the flashlamps so laser would be in perfect working order. Constantine, the delivery specialist was easy and very pleasant to deal with as well.  Highly recommend!",

      "text": "The Laser Agent is amazing! We were provided their information from our previous laser service that was no longer available. Laser agent was quick to respond and help walk us through the process of trouble shooting the laser unit prior to shipping it out to them. The turnaround time was quick, and they even facetimed to help us set it up once it was returned to us. Liz and the technicians are GREAT!",

I did send in my old CO2 laser to be evaluated and repaired and was able to speak with Josh, the technician, on the phone after it was shipped back to me to set it up. He is very knowledgeable. So far, it is working much better and I feel that I have great backup if needed for problems in the future. Shipping it back and forth was very easy. Thank you!",

I sent a message on the weekend inquiring about a laser and received an immediate response from the owner.  I was hesitant to work with a private company and just send money or a credit card without knowing them. They willingly shipped me my laser and allowed me to pay at the time of delivery. Drew and Liz worked with me on a daily basis to ensure I had the right equipment at great prices; they are honest and trustworthy.  I will continue to reach out to them with future laser needs and highly recommend them to anyone looking for used equipment. Thanks so much!! I LOVE my laser :)",

We had a relative go to the facility to compare two machine as we were interested in purchasing one of them. She said she felt very welcome and was never rushed.  They walked her through both machines which helped us determine the one we wanted to purchase.  We had no issues purchasing the machine and setting up delivery. We were contacted with some optional delivery dates/times. I asked if the delivery driver could contact me when he was 30 minutes away from the delivery address so someone could be there, which he did. The delivery driver was extremely courteous, professional and made sure everything was good before leaving. About an hour later we  were contacted to make sure everything was delivered to our satisfaction and made sure we knew if we needed anything to reach out and they would help us. I would definitely recommend the laser agent to anyone shopping for these type of products. It is hard to find customer service like this these days.  A great company with great employees!!",
